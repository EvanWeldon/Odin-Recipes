This is the Project: Recipes assignment from The Odin Project Foundations HTML course.
In this project I have:
1. Practiced using the basic HTML boilerplate
2. Created a very basic homepage with a link to my Recipe pages in an unordered list
3. Created three recipe pages with:
    - A heading
    - Images of the finished dish
    - An unordered list of ingredients
    - An ordered list of directions
